# Heart-Failure-Dashboard

##Overview
This project is a comprehensive Heart Failure Dashboard designed to analyze and visualize survival outcomes in patients with heart failure. The dataset contains 299 individuals, including demographic, clinical, and laboratory parameters. The dashboard provides an interactive and detailed breakdown of survival rates based on various factors like anemia, high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking status, and more. It aims to identify trends and relationships between these variables and patient outcomes (survival or death).

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to leverage data visualization to better understand the factors influencing survival rates in heart failure patients. By presenting the data in an intuitive and accessible format, the dashboard aids healthcare professionals and researchers in identifying critical risk factors and patterns that could inform treatment strategies or further research.
